# mdbook-collector

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/mdbook-collector)](https://crates.io/crates/mdbook-collector)

A [mdbook preprocessor](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/configuration/preprocessors.html) which collects json/yaml/toml data from each post and builds a json file of it


## Install
```
cargo install mdbook-collector
```

## Use (v0.2.0)
In a markdown file of a post, include:
```html
<!-- collect
{
  "data": {
    "type": "json",
    "keywords": ["json", "collect"]
  }
}
-->
```
Then the preprocessor will parse each post and build a consolidated json file, which is a map whose key is each post's **url path** and whose values are **sub-map** of parsed data. The title of each post will also be added to the sub-map, with a key name "title".
```json
{
  "post/ex/url": {
    "title": "Title of this post",
    "data" {
      "type": "json",
      "keywords": ["json", "collect"]
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

* Mind that in the v.0.1.0, the key of this map was post's name(title). From v.0.2.0, each post's url path is the key. And the title will be added to each sub map.


This newly created json file can be used for various purposes: ex. in your additional .js files.

Make sure that each post's raw json data should be able to be parsed into "map" structure. For example, below will not be parsed and thus be ignored:
```html
<!-- collect
  "data": {
    "type": "json",
    "keywords": ["json", "collect"]
  }
-->
```

If Json's strictness and no-comment-ness bothers you, use yaml or toml option!

## Configuration
Configuration example in `book.toml`. Below is default setting:
```toml
[preprocessor.collector]
input_type = "json"
marker = "collect"
save_path = "collect.json"
add_title = true
```

### input_type
The output file is always in .json format. However you can select to-be-parsed input data's format among `json`, `yaml`, or `toml`.

For example, using `toml`:
```
<!-- collect
  [data]
  type = "toml"
  keywords=["toml", "collect"] # any comment
-->
```

The preprocessor depends on `serde_json` for json option, `serde_yaml` for yaml, and `toml` for toml. The `yaml` and `toml` options parse not only oneselves' format but also json format, as their dependant crates work in such ways.

### marker
The preprocessor tries to parse any literal located between the first `<!-- collect` and `-->` in each post's source file. (`<!--collect` instead of `<!-- collect` is ok.)

You can change the marking literal. Default is `collect`.

### save_path
Newly created json file will be saved at a path which combines book's `src` directory and the given `save_path`.

It must be saved under the `src` directory to be auto copied into build-dir.

> ðŸª§ Mind that the `mdbook serve` watches `src` directory. Once you start `mdbook serve` command then change any contents under `src` directory, the collector will rebuild the json file and this leads to a repeat loop of watch and serve. To prevent this, make a **.gitignore** file at the book's root directory and add the to-be-built json file's name.


### add_title
The collector makes a json map whose key is each post's url path and whose value is a sub map parsed from each post's source file.

The collector insert one more information to the sub map: each post's title as a value and "title" as a key. If you don't want to add title info, set `add_title` false.
